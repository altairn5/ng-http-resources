#Angular Resources

This repo is to accompany this [lesson](https://github.com/sf-wdi-21/notes/blob/master/week-10/day-02-ng-routing-resources/dusk-ng-http/readme.md). Among other things, it covers routing, the `$http` object, and factories.

To get started make sure to run a server. One option is `python -m HTTPSimpleServer`.
